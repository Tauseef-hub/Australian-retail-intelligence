## 🎯 Business Problem

Australian retailers face inventory management challenges with 15-20% waste and 8% stockout rates. This system provides data-driven forecasting and analytics to optimize inventory decisions and reduce costs.

## 📊 Project Overview

A full-stack retail analytics platform that:
- Extracts real-time data from Australian Bureau of Statistics API
- Stores and processes 346,761+ retail sales records
- Provides time series forecasting for inventory planning
- Delivers interactive business intelligence dashboards

## 🏗️ Architecture
ABS API → Python ETL → PostgreSQL (Cloud) → FastAPI → Power BI Dashboard

**Current Stack:**
- **Data Source**: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Retail Trade API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Supabase (Singapore region)
- **ETL**: Python with pandas, SQLAlchemy
- **API**: FastAPI (planned)
- **ML Model**: Prophet time series forecasting (planned)
- **Dashboards**: Streamlit + Power BI (planned)
- **Deployment**: Render.com (planned)
